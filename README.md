# f_u_ruby
f_u_ruby, or "F*@k YoU, Ruby!" is a repository built out of frustration towards Ruby, and its ducktyping despite not providing equivalent methods for its various types.

At present, this is a work-in-progress, do not use it.

For example, ducktyped hashes vs Arrays: one you have to "foo do |element|" but with the other you have to "foo.each do |element|". This is basically a collection of overloads to fix the poorly designed Ruby ducktyping..
